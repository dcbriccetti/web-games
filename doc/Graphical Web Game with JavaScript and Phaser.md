# Graphical Web Game with JavaScript and Phaser

## Session 1
### Goals
- Understand a very simple Web app with JavaScript
- Become familiar with Phaser via the [sandbox](http://phaser.io/sandbox)
- Learn to use an integrated development environment (IDE) for web development
- Learn to clone or copy code from Github
- Learn to enhance a simple Phaser program in the IDE

### Introduction
#### [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
#### [Phaser](http://phaser.io)

### Activities
- Walk through a [very simple Web app](https://github.com/dcbriccetti/web-games/tree/master/simple-js/index.html)
with JavaScript
  - Add a feature to have the random number update every second

## Phaser [Sandbox](http://phaser.io/sandbox) Challenges

### Platformer
- Change how high the character jumps
- Add another platform
- Let the character leave the screen
- Replace the character graphic

### Shoot ’em Up
- Change how fast the player moves
- Change how fast the bullets move
- Change how quickly the bullets fire
- Make the sprite move in all four directions

## Getting Code from Github
Go to Dave’s [web-games](https://github.com/dcbriccetti/web-games) Github
repository and clone it (if you know how), or download a zip and extract all the files.
Store your copy of the repository (a directory called `web-games-master`) in a location you will remember.

## Using NetBeans
In NetBeans, create a project using the repository:
- Choose File -> New Project, then HTML5 Application with Existing Sources
- Set the Site Root to the `web-games-master` directory.
- Push `Finish`
- Expand the project in the Project window and under Site Root, expand simple-js
- Double-click index.html
- Right-click in the large window showing index.html and choose Run File. Your browser should now show
a simple web app that displays a random number.
